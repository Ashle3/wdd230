            <p>In this example, Target.com groups the four images, not only through proximity, 
                but through design as well. All the images associated with Fall in this screenshot, have a peachy/orange 
                background color. All the bold text labeling these images have the same burgundy color 
                as well. This repetetion of style and color across these images, let us know that they 
                are associated with each other, and that they all lead us to Fall products when we click on
                them.

            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <p>H-E-B</p>

            <p>
                The Rule of Thirds states that humans tend to focus their eyes on an invisible 3x3 grid whenever they
                look at a picture. Therefore, marketers tend to place images, or other items of importance, along
                this invisible grid. In the mobile view, this image from the HEB webspage perfectly demonstrates the Rule of Thirds,
                by placing items like the bread, pumpkins, and call to action, along the vertical lines of the grid. As a result,
                our eyes are drawn to those areas.

            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>Taco Bell</p>
            <a href="https://www.tacobell.com/">tacobell.com</a>
            <img class="tacobell_pic" src="images/tacobell.png" alt="TacoBell.com example of Visual Hierarchy">
            <p>In this screenshot, the Taco Bell webpage provides a good example of visual hierarchy.
            Visual hierarchy makes items of more importance bigger and more noticeable, so that our 
            eyes will be drawn to those items first. When looking at the Taco Bell webpage, one of the first things
             we notice is the picture of the Mexican Pizza they are trying to sell. The second thing we notice is 
             the words that tell us what it is (Mexican Pizza) and the call to action button that says ORDER NOW. 
             Naturally, seeing the food first and then the ORDER NOW button, makes it more likely that viewer will
             place an order themselves, compared to if the webpage didn't have visual hierarchy.
