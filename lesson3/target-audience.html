        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>The target audience this website is trying to reach, is business owners that are looking for opportunities
            to promote their business. They will be looking for advertisement that is reasonable, both financially
            and logistically, and will be looking to see if their local Chamber of Commerce offers both. Since they 
            are business owners, most of them will be adults at a minimum age of 30 and up. At least in the city
            of Frisco, they will more than likely be married/in a relationship, and might have kids. Since they 
            are business owners, they will have had a reasonable amount of experience running and managing businesses,
            and will therefore have a pretty clear picture on how they want their business advertised. 
        </p>
        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <h3>Persona 1</h3>
        <p>Mary is a small business owner who opened her bakery within the last year. Business has been going
            well, but she hasn't been getting as much foot traffic as she would have liked. She wants a way to 
            advertise her store beyond just social media posts, and wants to become more involved in the 
            community. She learned recently that the Frisco Chamber of Commerce might have the ammenities she 
            had been looking for, and wants to investigate the Chamber more to find out exactly what it is they offer
            local businesses.
        </p>
        <h3>Persona 2</h3>
        <p>Rodrigo runs a small Italian restaurant, and is looking to expand his business, but  
            needs a lot to put his new store at. He is very busy running his restaurant, and needs help picking out a location.
            He wishes there was an easy way to network with other companies to see if they knew of any available lots that
            were nearby. He heard of the Frisco Chamber of Commerce, but wasn't sure if he should join because it might be 
            too expensive. Was there a way he could still join the Chamber without having to spend too much money?
