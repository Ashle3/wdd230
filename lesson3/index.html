        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>The Frisco Chamber of Commerce was created to promote the interests of 
            local businesses, and to support their growth through local networking and community connectivity.
            This website provides a virtual space for businesses to join our Chamber of Commerce, and thus, 
            become a vital part of the community through exposure, and support among other like-minded businesses. 
            Joining our website allows your business's website to be listed on our virtual directory, which increases your exposure among community members, as well as local businesses. We believe that local businesses working together towards a 
            common goal, will strengthen community bonds, and will benefit the city of Frisco by increasing morale,
            and by making Frisco a place where people want to be.
