        <p class="aboutinfo">Bountiful Foods was founded in 1984, by Ted Mooney and his wife, Lisa Armstrong. Living in Carlsbad, they wanted to fresh fruits and vegetables that were as easy to access as regular grocery store produce, but of much higher quality. So, after reaching out to local farmers, they opened up their first farmer's market in the Summer of 1984. This farmer's market provided all the fresh fruits and vegetables one could need, at a fraction of the cost.</p>
        <p class="aboutinfo">The farmer's market was such a success, that it came back every summer after that. Then, in 2000, Ted and Lisa's son, Roger, took over as head of the company, and wanted to make the farmer's market into a year-round business. And thus, Bountiful Foods as we know it today was born.</p>
